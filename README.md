 🎤 Speech Emotion Recognition using Python | Sound Classification 🎶

 📖 Overview

Welcome to Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)**! This project dives deep into the fascinating world of detecting human emotions from speech. Ever wondered if a machine could sense your emotions just by listening to your voice? Well, now it can! 😃 😢 😡

Using cutting-edge Python libraries and machine learning techniques, this project aims to classify emotions based on sound data, making it perfect for applications like virtual assistants, call centers, and interactive voice systems. 🚀

 ✨ Features

- 🎧 Recognizes emotions from speech audio files.
- 🎼 Preprocessing: Cleans and extracts features from audio signals.
- 🤖 Machine learning model for accurate classification.
- 🎯 Multi-emotion support (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.).
- 🔍 Tested on real-world datasets for emotion detection.

 💻 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Libraries: 
  - `librosa` for audio processing 🎶
  - `sklearn` for machine learning 🤖
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data wrangling 📊
  - `matplotlib` for visualization 📈
  - Optional: `tensorflow`/`keras` for deep learning 🧠

 📂 Dataset

This project uses standard datasets to train and evaluate the model. Some recommended datasets:
- RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) 🎭
- TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set) 🎙️
- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h4RUPD88rqX2iHAbps8z0WBKeKdOfkMX?usp=drive_link 

Feel free to explore and add your own datasets!

🚀 Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset and update file paths as needed.

🎬 Usage

After setup, you can start training the model and making predictions!

1. Feature extraction: Convert audio files into useful features like MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), Chroma, and Spectral features.
2. Training: Use a classifier like SVM or a deep learning model like CNN.
3. Prediction: Test the model on new audio files.

Run the following commands:
```bash
python train_model.py
python predict_emotion.py --file_path your_audio_file.wav
```
